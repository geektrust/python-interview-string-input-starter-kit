# Python Interview – String Input Starter Kit

This repository provides a **generic starter kit** for solving **interview-style problems in Python**, where inputs are passed as **raw strings via the command line**.

It is designed to simulate real interview environments where:

* Inputs are not interactive
* Parsing is part of the problem
* Only correct logic and output matter

---

## 📌 Problem Description

Each problem will:

* Provide one or more **input strings**
* Expect you to parse the string(s)
* Apply the required business / algorithmic logic
* Print the final result to the console

The exact problem statement, constraints, and expected output format will be provided separately.

---

## 🔢 Input / Output Format (Generic)

### Input

```
<input string 1>
<input string 2>
...
```

* Inputs are passed as **command-line arguments**
* Each argument is treated as **one complete input string**

### Output

```
<problem-specific output>
```

* Output must match the expected format **exactly**
* No extra logs or debug prints

## 📂 Project Structure

```
.
├── run.sh               # Runs the solution with given input strings
├── run_unittests.sh     # Executes all unit tests
├── main.py              # Your implementation
├── test_sample.py               # Unit tests
└── README.md            # Documentation
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Solution

Use `run.sh` to execute the program with input strings.

### Syntax

```bash
./run.sh '<input 1>' '<input 2>' ...
```

### Example

```bash
./run.sh '3 Paris one-way' '2 London'
```

Each quoted value is passed as a **single string argument** to your program.

## 🧠 Input Handling Guidelines

* Do **not** use interactive input (`input()`)
* All inputs are already provided to your program as strings
* You are responsible for:

  * Splitting the input
  * Extracting required values
  * Typecasting (int, float, enum, etc.) when needed

---

## 🧾 Output Rules

* Print the final result to **stdout**
* Follow the exact output format mentioned in the problem statement
* Avoid extra spaces, newlines, or debug messages

---

## 🛠️ Where to Implement

Write your solution in:

```python
main.py
```

The `handle` method is the main entry point where:

1. Input string(s) are received
2. Parsing and validation happen
3. Final output is printed

---

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests

To run all unit tests:

```bash
./run_unittests.sh
```

### Notes

* Tests validate **exact output**
* Formatting matters
